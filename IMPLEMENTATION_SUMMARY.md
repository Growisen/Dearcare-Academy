   - GET: Fetch students and attendance for supervisor
   - POST: Mark/update attendance for specific student

2. **`/api/student-attendance`**

   - GET: Fetch attendance records for student with statistics

3. **`/api/supervisor-students`**
   - GET: Fetch all assigned students for supervisor with statistics
